### Info

#### This is a repository for a project to identify when and where to send staff during the upcoming Influenza season.

#### A hospital staffing agency provides temporary workers to clinics and hospitals on an as-needed basis. The objective of this analysis is to help plan for influenza season, a time when additional staff are in high demand. The final results will examine trends in influenza and how they can be used to proactively plan for staffing needs across the country.
